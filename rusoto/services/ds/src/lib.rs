//! <p><fullname>AWS Directory Service</fullname> <p>AWS Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup and run directories in the AWS cloud, or connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. This guide provides detailed information about AWS Directory Service operations, data types, parameters, and errors. For information about AWS Directory Services features, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/">AWS Directory Service</a> and the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html">AWS Directory Service Administration Guide</a>.</p> <note> <p>AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Directory Service and other AWS services. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note></p>
