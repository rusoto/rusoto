//! <p><fullname>Amazon Macie Classic</fullname> <p>Amazon Macie Classic is a security service that uses machine learning to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS. Macie Classic recognizes sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII) or intellectual property, and provides you with dashboards and alerts that give visibility into how this data is being accessed or moved. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/userguide/what-is-macie.html">Amazon Macie Classic User Guide</a>. </p> <p>A new Amazon Macie is now available with significant design improvements and additional features, at a lower price and in most AWS Regions. We encourage you to explore and use the new and improved features, and benefit from the reduced cost. To learn about features and pricing for the new Amazon Macie, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/macie/">Amazon Macie</a>.</p></p>
