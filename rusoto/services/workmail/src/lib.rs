//! <p>Amazon WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendaring service with support for existing desktop and mobile email clients. You can access your email, contacts, and calendars using Microsoft Outlook, your browser, or their native iOS and Android email applications. You can integrate Amazon WorkMail with your existing corporate directory and control both the keys that encrypt your data and the location in which your data is stored.</p> <p>The Amazon WorkMail API is designed for the following scenarios:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Listing and describing organizations</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Managing users</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Managing groups</p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Managing resources</p> </li> </ul> <p>All Amazon WorkMail API actions are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkMail site, the IAM user gains full administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkMail organization (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to create, update, and delete users, groups, and resources. This allows developers to perform the scenarios listed above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis using the IAM model.</p>
//!
//! If you're using the service, you're probably looking for [WorkmailClient](struct.WorkmailClient.html) and [Workmail](trait.Workmail.html).
